# SonicTag
AI based music genre predictor

This project works best with the GTZAN Music Genre Dataset. 

1. Train your own model by running sonictag.py or use the saved model music_genre_model.pkl  
2. The functionality of the algorithm lies in predict_genre.py
3. Run the UI based web app from app.py

Enjoy!
